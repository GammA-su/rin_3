PageRank is a link‑analysis algorithm that assigns a numerical weight to each web page based on the structure of incoming links. It models a “random surfer” who follows hyperlinks with probability d (typically 0.85) and jumps to a random page with probability 1 – d. The rank of page P is the sum of the ranks of all pages that link to P, each divided by the linking page’s out‑link count, multiplied by d, plus a uniform teleportation term. Thus, a page’s score depends not only on how many links point to it but also on the quality (rank) of those linking pages and the distribution of their outbound links. This resolves the common misconception that PageRank is merely a link count; it is a recur
