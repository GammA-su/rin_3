PageRank estimates a page’s importance by treating the Web as a directed graph. Each page distributes an equal share of its “rank” to all pages it links to, but the share is weighted by the rank of the linking page. The algorithm iterates until ranks converge, using a damping factor (≈0.85) that models a random surfer’s chance of jumping to a random page. Thus, a page gains high rank not merely by having many inbound links, but by being linked from other high‑rank pages; the link count alone is insufficient. The method was first described in Brin and Page’s 1998 paper and formalized in Google’s 1998 patent, which also introduced the damping factor and the iterative computation. Subsequent Go
