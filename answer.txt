PageRank is a link‑analysis algorithm that assigns a numerical weight to each web page, reflecting its “importance” in the web graph. It was first described by Sergey Brin and Lawrence Page in 1998 as part of Google’s search engine architecture [1]. The algorithm models a random surfer who follows hyperlinks with probability d (the damping factor, usually 0.85) and jumps to a random page with probability 1 – d. A page’s rank is the sum of the ranks of all pages that link to it, divided by each linking page’s out‑link count, and then multiplied by d plus a uniform teleportation term [2]. This recursive definition means that a link from a highly ranked page contributes more than a link from a
