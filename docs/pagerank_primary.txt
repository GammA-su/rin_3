PageRank (Brin & Page, 1998) models a random surfer: with probability d≈0.85 they follow an outlink; with 1−d they “teleport” to any page. The stationary distribution of this Markov chain is the PageRank vector. Each page j distributes its rank PR(j) evenly across its outlinks via PR(i) ← Σ_j PR(j)/L(j) scaled by d, plus (1−d)/N teleportation. Teleportation prevents rank sinks and ensures convergence on a strongly connected graph. Quality of incoming links matters because rank passed from a highly ranked page is worth more than rank from a low-ranked page; outdegree normalization L(j) dilutes per-link influence from “hubby” pages.
